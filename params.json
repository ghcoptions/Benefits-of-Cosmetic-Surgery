{"name":"Benefits-of-cosmetic-surgery","tagline":"","body":"Cosmetic surgery is a branch of plastic surgery which in the last decades has gained the sympathy and the interest of those who want a younger and a more attractive look. \r\n\r\nMany times cosmetic surgery is thought to be the same with plastic surgery but in reality these two are just closely related medical specialties. Both specialties are dealing with improving a person’s body or appearance, but cosmetic surgery’s main and only focus is on the enhancement of a person’s appearance.\r\n\r\nCosmetic surgery procedures include:\r\n•\tBreast Enlargement: lifting, augmentation, reduction;\r\n•\tFacial Contouring surgeries such as rhinoplasty, mentoplasty (chin), chin liposuction, cheek augmentation;\r\n•\tFacial Rejuvenation procedures such as facelift, neck lift, brow lift, or blepharoplasty (eyelid), lip enhancement, otoplasty (ear);\r\n•\tHand Rejuvenation;\r\n•\tPhotorejuvenation such as lasers or photodynamic therapies to eliminate wrinkles, spots and textures;\r\n•\tBody Contouring procedures such as liposuction or gynecomastia.\r\n\r\nObviously, the main scope of these procedures is to create a better appearance and look of the patients. They imply both physical and emotional benefits. \r\n\r\nPatients usually get immediate results so the physical benefits are very obvious. Nevertheless, for most of the patients emotional aspects are the most important when considering this type of intervention.  Many persons consider cosmetic surgery in order to look better, to confirm with today’s society standards or to look more attractive to the opposite sex. It is known the fact that these procedures boost the self-esteem and increase confidence; such confidence will generate positive vibes and will influence multiple aspects of life: social, professional or love life. \r\nSocial anxiety is often triggered by the awareness of one’s physical flaws, thing that can be a determining factor in regard to the lack of initiative or lack of success. For many patients, correcting a physical flaw will give them the necessary courage to step forward and to stand for themselves. \r\n\r\nProfessional and social benefits\r\nMany sociological and psychological studies have proved that physical attractive persons are perceived as more intelligent, more honest, successful and capable. Same studies have shown correlations between the same factor of attractiveness and professional recognition, employment opportunities and promotion. On a social level it was also demonstrated that an attractive person receives high-quality services and is usually treated with more respect. \r\nAll of the above mentioned aspects prove that indeed, an enhancement of the physical appearance can provide many social and professional benefits. \r\n\r\nHealth and overall life quality benefits\r\nProcedures which have the aim to correct functional aspects of the body present significant health and life quality benefits. For example, patients who went through a procedure in order to remove their unaesthetic skin caused by weight loss may manifest an interest in exercise, thing that will lead to the improvement of their physical and emotional life; patients whose vision has considerably improved with the help of a blepharoplasty; women with large breasts who seek a breast reduction in order to diminish the pressure from their bodies etc. \r\n\r\nThe [benefits of cosmetic surgery](http://ghcoptions.com/beauty/#cosmetic) are pretty obvious.
